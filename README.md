# Steam Tracker
Track a Steam user gaming hours and log to file, then turn that data into a histogram.

There is no reason why you'd want to do this other than mocking a friend about his excessive, and possibly unhealthy gameplay.

I call this from a cron job every 5 minutes, but you could set it up to run in a simple loop.
